```shellscript
 ./ltse -token={YOUR-SLACK-TOKEN} -prefix={EMOJI-PREFIX} -id={LINE EMOJI ID}

For example, if you'd like to upload the emoji sticker:  
`https://store.line.me/emojishop/product/5e4f906cd8824d19066dfc58/en`  

The `id` would be `5e4f906cd8824d19066dfc58`.

If your prefix is `shiba_puppy`, and the emoji code in Slack would be `shiba_puppy_1`, `shiba_puppy_2`...etc.
